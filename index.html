<!--Introduction Section-->
<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>

    Over the years, cosmetic surgery has grown in both popularity and accessibility. Societal
    beauty standards are promoted in movies, magazines, television shows, and social media.
    Most people do not fit into cookie-cutter expectations of perfection, and thus some turn to cosmetic
    surgery in order to attain the beauty ideals presented to them. Cosmetic surgery, as many of you
    are aware, is a procedure where the patient has a part of their body altered for cosmetic reasons.

</p>

<p>

    Popular cosmetic surgeries are liposuction, which is a fat removal procedure, breast augmentation,
    which alters the size and shape of the breasts, and rhinoplasty, which changes the shape of the nose.
    Certain procedures, such as the Brazilian butt lift and buccal fat removal, have become trends. Many
    celebrities, like the Kardashians, have gotten work done. This has led to cosmetic surgery becoming
    more well known. Social media has also played a role, as unrealistic beauty standards are propagated
    by social media apps like Instagram. Another factor is that cosmetic surgery has decreased in price
    and there are more and more cosmetic surgeons offering their services.  

</p>

<p>

    As a college student who is active on social media, I have personally been exposed to a lot of information
    regarding cosmetic surgery. Seeing the advertisements of cosmetic surgeons on Instagram has intrigued me.
    I see so much promotion of cosmetic procedures, but never hear about the effects. I began to wonder whether
    cosmetic surgery was even worth it. This prompted me to research cosmetic surgery in depth. What are the effects
    of cosmetic procedures? And how do other college students feel about them? I needed answers.

</p>

<p>

    After extensive research, I have gained a better understanding of cosmetic surgery and I would like to share
    my findings with you. Although some people are completely against cosmetic surgery, college students should be 
    able to undergo cosmetic procedures as long as they are aware of the consequences. Some of the consequences can 
    cause pain and discomfort while others are more severe. Cosmetic surgery is a big decision and should be thought about carefully.

<!--Causes-->
<h2><u>Causes of Cosmetic Surgery</u></h2>

<p>

    Before diving into the ways cosmetic surgery can affect people, I believe it is important to analyze why people pursue
    these procedures in the first place. My research has shown me that there is a variety of factors that can motivate
    people to get cosmetic surgery, and our society as a whole may be to blame.

</p>

<h3>Beauty Standards and Materialism</h3>

<p>

    Beauty standards and materialism have become very prevalent in American society, and Donna Henderson-King and Kelly 
    D. Brooks explain their role in the cosmetic surgery industry in their article "Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance 
    Messages, and Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic Surgery." They surveyed female 
    undergraduate college students. Based on their findings, "Women who were higher on internalization and materialism were 
    more likely to accept cosmetic surgery for intrapersonal reasons and for social reasons, to consider having cosmetic surgery, 
    and to report a desire for more cosmetic surgery procedures" (Henderson-King, Kelly pg. 138). As psychology professors with Phds., their information 
    is well-founded, as they have an advanced understanding of how the mind works and why people think the way they do. Based on this
    quote, it is clear that internalizing beauty standards can affect the way people view cosmetic surgery. This makes sense since 
    cosmetic surgery can be a tool to help fit into current beauty standards, as someone can achieve certain features even if they were 
    not born with them. Evidently, beauty standards have a great influence on people. This is no secret to us college students, and 
    this article validates our experiences and provides clear evidence of the effects that beauty standards are having on people. 
    It also makes sense that materialism can promote acceptance of cosmetic surgery and the desire to undergo it. People who are 
    materialistic place value on physical appearance, and therefore it is easy to see why someone who is materialistic would want to 
    change theirs. The results of Henderson-King and Brooks' study confirm that beauty standards and materialism can all 
    play a role in a young woman’s opinions on cosmetic surgery.

</p>

<h3>Body Dysmorphic Disorder</h3>

<p>

    Another reason someone may choose to undergo cosmetic surgery is because of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is a disorder
    where a person has an obsession with a perceived flaw of their appearance. This disorder can have a great negative impact on
    someone's quality of life and self-esteem. Adriana C. Panayi investigated the frequency of BDD among cosmetic surgery patients
    in her article  “The Prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder In Patients Undergoing Cosmetic Surgery: A Systematic Review.”
    Here, Panayi states that "The rate of BDD in patients seeking cosmetic surgery was originally thought to be 2%, which is similar
    to the rate seen in the general population (Andreasen 1977). More recent studies, however, indicate a much higher rate of BDD"
    and "This data suggests that BDD has the highest prevalence in cosmetic surgery populations, followed by the student population, 
    and is least prevalent in the general community" (Panayi pg. S440). Based on this information, BDD is evidently more common amongst people 
    who get cosmetic surgery as opposed to the rest of the population. This likely is not a coincidence. It is safe to assume that
    BDD can be a contributing factor in someone pursuing cosmetic surgery. This makes a lot of sense since BDD patients struggle
    with accepting a physical trait about themselves that they view as a flaw. For people dealing with BDD, their obsession
    over this flaw goes far beyond an insecurity. Instead, it is something that greatly impairs their enjoyment of life. Cosmetic 
    surgery can be used to "correct" their perceived flaw, and thus it is easy to see why someone with BDD would desire cosmetic surgery.
    This can also tie in with the beauty standards that I discussed previously, as beauty standards may contribute to or worsen BDD.

</p>

<h3>Social Media</h3>

<p>

    There is another factor for why someone may want cosmetic surgery, and it is one many of you are familiar with: social media.
    Social media has become extremely popular. Many social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok are widely used, especially by
    college students. Social media influencers, who are typically conventionally attractive, have become greatly admired. Social media
    also takes advantage of filters, which can alter a person's face and body. Dr. Sepideh Saber, a board certified plastic surgeon,
    discusses social media's influence in her blog entry "The 'Instaface Effect': How Social Media Shapes Plastic Surgery
    Expectations." According to Dr. Saber, "... 72% of cosmetic surgeons saw patients who 'wanted to look better in selfies' coming 
    for consultations. In 2021, a survey study by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons showed that nearly half of all patients 
    reported social media played a role in their decision to seek plastic surgery" (Saber, 2022). This data is astounding and shows the extent to
    which social media is affecting us. It is undeniable that social media is motivating people to receive cosmetic procedures and 
    alter their appearances. When people are exposed to images of perfection on social media, it makes sense that they would want
    to replicate the appearances of their highly admired influencers. The filters that I previously mentioned are also likely to play
    a role. Someone may like the changes a filter made to their appearance and thus try to recreate it in real life. 
    
</p>

<p>

    Social media's effects are also highlighted by Josh Wilson in his article "Cosmetic Surgery Is On The Rise With Technology And Hollywood Is At The 
    Center Of It". In this article, Wilson cites various plastic surgeons who say social media has contributed to the increased popularity
    of cosmetic procedures. Wilson cites Darren Smith, a surgeon, who said "'I think social media plays a tremendous role,' he said. 
    'We're seeing social media setting all kinds of trends, as people are having faster and more frequent access to latest celebrity looks 
    and trends.'" (Wilson, 2023). There is a lot of validity to Smith's statement. Many celebrities are extremely active on social media. Since celebrities
    are greatly looked up to, they can have a lot of influence on their fans. Some fans may even want to look like their favorite celebrities
    or may view a celebrity as the epitome of beauty. Seeing the frequent pictures that celebrities post on social media can increase these feelings.

</P>

<p>
   
    The American Society of Plastic Surgeons further confirms the role that social media plays. In their article "American Society of Plastic 
    Surgeons Weighs in on Growing Popularity of Teen Plastic Surgery", they discuss the factors that contribute to the desire among teenagers
    to undergo cosmetic procedures. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons states "In an age of selfies and constant social media sharing, 
    a growing number of teenagers are undergoing plastic surgery to alter their appearance" and "...today's social media-obsessed culture 
    has contributed dramatically to a rise in plastic surgery..." (The American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 2018). The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is a leading information source
    when it comes to cosmetic surgery and consists of many board-certified cosmetic surgeons. It also lists real statistics and facts while 
    taking a neutral stance. Clearly, it is an extremely credible source. By admitting how social media is responsible for the increase 
    of teens undergoing cosmetic procedures, they confirm how influential it has become. This also shows how the desire for cosmetic procedures 
    can be born at a very young age. College students were teenagers at some point. In fact, some of them still can be if they are 18 or 19. If someone 
    begins to want a cosmetic procedure when they are a teenager, it is likely that this desire can follow them into college. As a college student, cosmetic 
    surgery can become even more accessible compared to when they were high schoolers. It is safe to infer that social media has a great amount of influence on college
    students.

</p>

<h3>Romance</h3>

<p>

    Aside from social media, romance can also persuade someone to get cosmetic procedures. Many people strongly desire romantic and sexual relationships,
    and this is especially true for college students. It is natural for humans to want to connect with each other and find partners.
    While this is not true for everyone, looks may play a role in some peoples' choice of partner. The aspect of romance is mentioned in the book 
    <i>Cosmetic Surgery for Dummies</i> by R. Merrel Olesen, a medical director, and Marie B.V. Olesen, a cosmetic surgery consultant. In this book,
    they mention various factors for why younger people are getting cosmetic surgery, and one of them is romance. They state that young adults 
    "... are also seeking romance, so how they look and feel about themselves is an important concern. They're not going to suffer in silence; 
    they're going to get it fixed" (Olesen, pg. 10). It is no surprise that the desire for romance plays a role in cosmetic surgery. Some people view
    their looks as the key to finding a partner, therefore if they feel that their looks are not up to par then they will find ways to improve them.
    While some people may wear makeup or dress nicely, others will go even further and alter the parts of themselves that they feel a partner will
    not view as desirable. Some people believe cosmetic surgery will be worth it if it means that they will become more attractive in the eyes
    of potential partners. Confidence is also important for some people when choosing partners. Confidence is typically a trait that many 
    people are attracted to. If someone gets cosmetic surgery and becomes more confident as a result, this will increase their desirability even more.
    Thus, it is understandable why romance can motivate people to get cosmetic procedures.

<h2><u>Dangers of Cosmetic Procedures</u></h2>

<P>

    Now that we have discussed some of the reasons people pursue cosmetic surgery, I would like to highlight some of the risks that go along with
    undergoing such procedures. These risks are not always talked about when cosmetic surgery is being discussed, and therefore I find great importance
    in pointing them out in order to ensure that people become more educated on this topic.

</P>

<h3>Dangers of Breast Augmentation</h3>

<p>

    One very popular procedure is breast augmentation, which can involve increasing breast size, decreasing breast size, and changing the breasts' shape.
    Despite the popularity of such procedures, their dangers often go unspoken. David B. Sarwer et al. study some of these dangers in his article 
    "Cosmetic Breast Augmentation Surgery: A Critical Overview". Sarwer has done a variety of research on body image and cosmetic surgery. He
    has been studying the subject since the 1990s. He has a deeper understanding of the motivations behind cosmetic surgery and how body image plays a role since
    he is a psychologist. Additionally, he is well versed in the history of breast augmentation. Many of the risks discussed by Sarwer are attributed to breast implants.
    When analyzing the consequences of silicone breast implants, Sarwer states "Most of the controversy surrounding the use of silicone implants has 
    been related to potential long-term complications. These complications include silicone bleed, autoimmune disease, polyurethane toxicity, and 
    implant rupture and leakage. These events may require surgical treatment or removal of the implant or may leave the patient with significant physical 
    discomfort or deformity" (Sarwer et al. pg. 846). Silicone bleed is when the gel within the implants leaks out into the surrounding tissues. An autoimmune disease causes 
    the immune system to not function properly and attack cells that are healthy. Some implants have been coated with polyurethane, a material that is commonly
    used in furniture. Polyurethane-coated implants can lead to complications like pain and infection. An implant rupture is exactly what it sounds like: 
    the implant's surface breaks and the materials within it can leak out, which can be painful. These complications certainly do not sound appealing, yet they 
    are not talked about as much as the procedures themselves. It is valid to be concerned about these complications. While not all of these issues are common,
    they are still a possibility. It is beneficial to be aware of these dangers because if they do occur, they can greatly decrease one's quality of life.
    Whether a complication is rare or not, people should always be aware of it and should be willing to accept the possibility of it occurring.

</p>

<p>

    There is, however, one complication that Sarwer listed that actually is quite common. This is the risk of implant rupture and leakage. According to Sarwer,
    "In prostheses removed from women up to 17 years after implantation, two thirds of implants (and all the implants over 10 years of age) were ruptured or
    leaking. In a similar study, 70% of removed implants 11–15 years old were found to be ruptured or leaking. Thus, it is likely that a woman will
    need several replacement implants throughout her lifetime" (Sarwer et al. pg. 846). Based on this data, it is undoubtedly likely that silicone breast implants will rupture 
    or leak at some point. While implant ruptures are not deadly, they can still cause physical pain for the woman. Aside from the physical discomfort that can be
    experienced due to implant rupture, this is definitely not comfortable for peoples' pocketbooks either. Replacing breast implants every few years will 
    certainly rack up the bills, and this is not a consequence that some people are willing to accept. Therefore, it is crucial to take this risk into account. 
    It will not only produce physical consequences, but financial ones as well.

</p>

<p>

    Silicone implants are not the only kinds that cause complications. Sarwer also highlights some of the risks associated with saline implants. 
    He states "Infrequent complications include hematoma, infection, and hypertrophic scarring, all of which are estimated to occur in 1%–3% 
    of cases. More frequent complications include capsular contracture, mammographic interference, breastfeeding difficulties, and loss of nipple 
    sensation, all of which are estimated to occur in 10%–35% of cases" (Sarwer et al. pg. 847). Hematoma is a collection of blood at the site of the implant
    and hypertrophic scarring is when thick, raised scars form. Capsular contracture is a negative bodily response to an implant in which the scar 
    tissue surrounding the implant hardens and contracts around it. Mammographic interference simply means that it is more difficult for mammograms
    to be performed, which can be dangerous since mammograms help detect breast cancer. Breastfeeding difficulties can be extremely distressing for 
    mothers and loss of nipple sensation can lead to a decrease of enjoyment of certain sexual activities. Evidently, saline implants have many complications 
    and even the less severe ones can still impact someone's quality of life. These complications should not be brushed off just because some of them are 
    rare. It is genuinely very important to take these consequences into account when making the decision to get saline implants. A small chance is still a chance.

</p>

<h3>Dangers of Minimally Invasive Procedures</h3>

<p>

    Even the less risky procedures come with some dangers. Procedures such as chemical peels, injectables, and fillers are typically viewed as safer than more 
    intrusive surgeries such as breast augmentation and liposuction. Although it is true that these procedures do not pose the same dangers as going under the knife 
    would, there is still a possibility of things going wrong. Lauren L. Levy and Jason E. Emer study the dangers of procedures such as injectables and chemical peels
    in their article "Complications of Minimally Invasive Cosmetic Procedures: Prevention and Management". A very common procedure discussed in this article 
    is botulinum toxin injections (BoNT). If that doesn't ring a bell, BoNT is commonly referred to as "Botox". BoNT has been used to treat certain health conditions
    like chronic migraines. However, since people realized its potential in the world of cosmetics, BoNT injections have exploded in popularity. While BoNT has been 
    effective at minimizing wrinkles, there are some temporary complications to be aware of. According to Levy and Emer, "More common complications of BoNT injection
    include local reactions such as bleeding, pain, oedema, erythema and ecchymosis at the injection site" (Levy, Emer pg. 122). Oedema is when fluids build up and cause swelling
    in the body. Erythema is when the skin begins to redden and ecchymosis is simply a fancy word for bruising. The bleeding and pain are certainly not ideal, and 
    the other effects mentioned can worsen someone's appearance as opposed to improving it. However, it is important to remember that these complications are temporary.
    Even though they will fade, some people may not want to deal with these complications in the first place, which is why it is important to take them into account 
    when making your decision to get BoNT injections. 

</p>

<p>

    Fillers are another popular low-risk procedure. Fillers have a variety of uses, such as making the face or lips appear fuller or smoothing wrinkles. 
    Levy and Emer state that "Local injection site reactions such as swelling, bruising, pain and pruritus are the most commonly reported adverse events" (Levy, Emer pg. 125).
    Swelling, bruising, and pain are self-explanatory, and pruritus is when the skin becomes irritated and itchy. As with the effects of BoNT injections, these 
    complications are short-term. Although they are transitory, some people may not want to experience these consequences at all, even for just a short time. Thus, 
    it is incredibly important to be made aware of them. If you decide that even the temporary consequences are not worth it, then you will have saved yourself from 
    going through unwanted pain and discomfort. It is also worth noting that the risk of complications occurring can be minimized if the person performing the procedure 
    is experienced and administers the BoNT and/or fillers correctly. In the scenario where someone does believe that the complications will be worth it, they should 
    be wise in their decision and go to a certified and experienced cosmetic surgeon. 

</p>

<p>

    One other procedure discussed in the article by Levy and Emer is chemical peels. Chemical peels are solutions applied to the face that remove the top layers of
    the skin and in doing so improves the skin's texture. While this may seem counterintuitive, the skin actually has a smoother texture and scarring is less visible
    once the skin heals. However, this does not mean that things will always go as expected. As with the previously discussed procedures, chemical peels have their 
    share of dangers. One of these is the possibility of scarring, and Levy and Emer say "Scars are the most dreaded complications of chemical peels and are 
    fortunately rare, reportedly occurring in less than 1% of medium-depth peels" (Levy, Emer pg. 130). As they stated, scarring is rare. However, rare does not equate to
    impossible. There is still a chance, however small, that your face could be permanently scarred. Considering that this is the complete opposite of what 
    someone would desire from a chemical peel, it is very important to be aware of this information. Hyperpigmentation can also occur after a chemical peel, although 
    it is usually temporary. The risk of chemical peels is very small, but any consequences can harm your skin and worsen its appearance. Thus, the possibilities 
    should be taken into account.

<h2><u>If There's Risks, Why Undergo Cosmetic Procedures?</u></h2>

<p>

    Some of you may be questioning why cosmetic procedures are even worth getting if there are so many things that can go wrong. Due to the risks, some people 
    may believe that no one should get cosmetic surgery at all and that nothing can be gained. While I encourage people to think deeply of the consequences of 
    cosmetic procedures, I am not completely against it and I disagree with the notion that cosmetic procedures only have harmful effects. Some people may be 
    surprised to learn about the various positive aspects of cosmetic procedures.

</p>

<h3>More Positive First Impressions</h3>

<p>

    One benefit that comes with cosmetic procedures is that people typically have more positive perceptions of someone who has undergone cosmetic surgery.
    When you do not know anything about a person, their looks are the only thing you have to go off of. After undergoing cosmetic procedures, a person 
    can have a more amiable appearance that will cause people to view them in a more positive light upon first meeting them. This behavior is discussed 
    in the article "Evaluation of Personality Perception in Men Before and After Facial Cosmetic Surgery" by Keon M. Parsa et al. Parsa states that 
    "Research on personality has shown that perceiving a person as attractive fosters positive expectations about his or her personal characteristics... 
    Thus, an individual’s well-being is meaningfully tied to how others perceive their facial features" (Parsa et al. pg. 370). This is superficial and someone's facial 
    features do not automatically correlate with their personality. However, it is the hard truth and making assumptions about someone based on their looks 
    is natural for humans. In the rest of the article, Parsa et al. analyze the data from a survey in which respondents were asked to assess men's personality 
    traits before and after undergoing a cosmetic procedure. Various procedures are discussed by Parsa, who states "...upper blepharoplasty, lower blepharoplasty, 
    brow-lift, face-lift, neck-lift, and rhinoplasty did show statistically significant changes in ratings" (Parsa et al. pg. 371). Parsa then goes on to say that 
    "For upper blepharoplasty, positive changes in the perception of likeability (0.72; 95% CI, 0.06-1.50) and trustworthiness (0.74; 95% CI, 0.22-1.25) were found. 
    Lower blepharoplasty was associated with a decrease in perceived risk seeking (−0.78; 95% CI, −1.45 to −0.10). Brow-lift was associated with an increased 
    perception of extroversion (0.78; 95% CI, 0.06-1.50) and risk seeking (−0.9; 95% CI, −1.62 to −0.18)" (Parsa et al. pg. 371). This is very intriguing data and 
    suggests that people genuinely are viewed more positively post-op. Likeability, trustworthiness, and extroversion are all traits that people are drawn to in 
    a person. If someone has these traits, they are more likely to be respected and treated with friendliness. It is undoubtedly a good thing to be viewed in a more 
    positive light, and this is one of the many benefits of cosmetic procedures. This can provide someone with more opportunities to make friends, get jobs, and 
    it can even increase their own confidence. Thus, it is valid to undergo a cosmetic procedure as being more positively perceived is only one of the many 
    benefits. 

</p>

<p>

    The other procedures mentioned by Parsa et al., which were face-lift, neck-lift, and rhinoplasty, were also associated with being more positively perceived by
    others. They were typically associated with the same likable traits as the other procedures mentioned. According to Parsa et al., "For face-lift procedures, 
    likeability (0.69; 95% CI, 0.08-1.30) and trustworthiness (0.66; 95% CI, 0.05-1.27) were perceived as having a positive change. Neck-lift was associated
    with an increase in perceived extroversion (0.60; 95% CI, 0.10-1.09) and masculinity (0.70; 95% CI, 0.21-1.19). Lastly, patients undergoing rhinoplasty 
    experienced an improvement in attractiveness (0.51; 95% CI, 0.03-1.00) with increased likeability (0.40; 95% CI, 0.03-1.00)" (Parsa et al. pg. 371).
    Likeability, trustworthiness, and extroversion were all positive traits that were also associated with the other procedures. However, there were also some 
    new traits that were brought up. Increased masculinity was associated with a neck-lift, and considering that the patients are all men, masculinity may be an 
    important factor in their lives. Unfortunately, society has an expectation that men are to be strong and masculine. If a man does not fit into society's standards of 
    manliness, then this can cause them to be made fun of and they may have lower-self esteem. For some men who are struggling with meeting society's definition of 
    masculine, a neck-lift can be very helpful with cultivating the masculine appearance that they desire. Another trait was attractiveness, which was increased in 
    patients who had undergone rhinoplasty. Attractiveness can be another important factor in men's lives. As I previously mentioned in the "Causes of Cosmetic 
    Surgery" section, looks can play a role in finding a partner. By undergoing rhinoplasty and becoming more attractive, this can increase a man's chance of 
    finding a partner. For some people, becoming more attractive will be worth getting a procedure done. 

</p>

<h3>Increased Confidence and Improved Mental Health</h3>

<p>

    Another perk of cosmetic procedures is that they can make people have better mental health and more confidence. When I previously talked about 
    Sarwer's article "Cosmetic Breast Augmentation Surgery: A Critical Overview", it was about the negative effects of breast augmentation. Although Sarwer talked 
    about many of the dangers that can occur from breast implants, he also describes some benefits. The benefits are related to feeling less depressed and having a 
    better body image. He states "As compared with preoperative levels, patients reported significant improvements in depressive symptoms and quality of life 6 months
    postoperatively" (Sarwer et al. pg. 851). This makes sense considering that deep insecurities about a physical feature can cause someone to seek cosmetic surgery. 
    Insecurities can be harmful to someone's mental health. In the case of breast augmentation, someone who is greatly insecure about the size and/or shape of 
    their breasts may feel depressed as a result. It is easy to understand why these women would have better mental health upon undergoing breast augmentation and 
    achieving the look they desire. Depression can also greatly affect one's quality of life. By getting breast augmentation and alleviating their depressive 
    symptoms, a woman can live a happier life. Sarwer also says "Results from a second investigation suggested that cosmetic surgery patients also report improvements 
    in body image. At 6 months postoperatively, patients reported a significant reduction in the degree of dissatisfaction with the body feature altered by surgery"
    (Sarwer et al. pg. 851). Evidently, cosmetic surgery can do wonders for someone's self-esteem. For some people, it can be very difficult to learn to love a part 
    of themselves that they dislike. If someone feels the need to undergo a cosmetic procedure, this may be a sign that their insecurity is affecting their perception 
    of themselves more severely than normal. For some people, cosmetic surgery is the key to learning to love themselves and finally being comfortable in their body. 
    Self love is very important. Thus, if a cosmetic procedure will help someone's body image and help them love themselves, the procedure may be worth getting. 
    This goes to show that cosmetic surgery does not only have dangerous consequences. It also can greatly improve someone's well-being. 


</p>

<p>

    Cosmetic surgery can bring out a more confident side of a person that they had not shown before. This is evident in a clip on the TODAY YouTube channel.
    The video clip is from the Today show and is titled "'Snapchat Dysmorphia': Why Teens Are Turning To Plastic Surgery." In this clip, the hosts of 
    the show discuss cosmetic surgery among teenagers and feature different guests that voice their perspectives on the matter. One of the people featured 
    in the video is a boy named Ryan who was born with large ears. He was bullied and called names as a result, which led him to get his ears surgically pinned 
    back at the age of 15. This procedure ended up giving Ryan more confidence. In regards to Ryan's procedure, a reporter states "It's changed his life, 
    gaining him new confidence and a girlfriend" (TODAY 2:28-2:33). Clearly, the procedure had a great effect on him since it was life changing. Ryan talked 
    about how he did not stand up for himself when he was getting bullied. He states "After the surgery, I won't let anyone mess with me" (TODAY 2:44-2:47).
    The fact that Ryan is able to stand up for himself now is a clear indicator of how much his confidence has increased. He no longer puts up with other peoples' 
    rude behavior. Now that he has an appearance that he is happier with, he is able to stick up for himself. This is an amazing benefit of cosmetic surgery. Due to 
    his increased confidence from his procedure, he will not allow people to bully him going forward. Standing up for yourself is important and it's great if a 
    cosmetic procedure can help someone do that. Evidently, there are many perks to undergoing cosmetic procedures and Ryan shows how beneficial they can be. 
    Therefore, I cannot support the belief that no one should ever get cosmetic surgery. As we have learned, cosmetic surgery's consequences are not all harmful or 
    dangerous. Some can have a positive impact on someone's life.

<h2><u>How Do College Students Feel?</u></h2>

<p>

    Now that we have learned about the causes, dangers, and benefits of cosmetic surgery, it's time to analyze how college students feel about the subject.
    Everyone is different and no two people think alike, so there are multiple perspectives to bring attention to. First, let's discuss why some college students 
    support cosmetic surgery.

</p>

<h3>Some Support It</h3>

<p>

    In another article titled "Body Image and Cosmetic Medical Treatments" that Sarwer wrote alongside Canice E. Crerand, he discusses a survey of over 500 
    female college students. In this survey, the students were asked whether they had undergone cosmetic surgery and whether they have ever considered it. 
    The article states "...5% indicated that they had undergone a cosmetic medical treatment; 40% said they would consider having surgery in the near future; 
    and 48% said they would consider it in middle age (Sarwer et al., 2003)" (Sarwer, Crerand pg. 101). This data shows how accepted cosmetic surgery is becoming 
    among college students. With the percentages added up, that means 93% of the students surveyed have either undergone a procedure already or desire one for some 
    point in their future. Evidently, these students are accepting of cosmetic surgery and approve of it. However, it is important to reiterate that this survey 
    consisted of only female college students. It does not account for the opinions of male students or ones that do not identify as male or female. Despite this, 
    the data is still a good indicator of how approval of cosmetic surgery is increasing, especially among college students.

</p>

<p>

    Dayanara Leonardo wrote an article for <i>The Valencia Voice</i>, which is the student newspaper for Valencia College, titled "Plastic Surgery on the Rise for 
    College Students". In this article, Leonardo showcases some students at Valencia College who approve of cosmetic surgery and have even undergone procedures themselves.
    One student named Ana Gabriela Delgado traveled to different countries for her procedures due to high costs in the United States. She has undergone multiple 
    procedures, including breast augmentation and rhinoplasty. According to Delgado, "'I am happier, I look prettier, and I have better self-esteem. I am delighted,'
    she said. As for if she would get future procedures, Delgado ecstatically replied, 'I would like to get another liposuction, and for my fat to be transferred 
    to my butt. I want my hips to be defined, look skinnier, and to have a bigger butt'" (Leonardo 2017). Clearly, Delgado vehemently approves of cosmetic surgery. 
    She is joyful about the changes her procedures have brought to her life. As a college student herself, Delgado is a perfect example of a college student who 
    supports cosmetic surgery. Her opinion is even more valid due to the fact that she has actually undergone procedures. She knows what it is like to get cosmetic 
    surgery and has firsthand experience with it. Leonardo also talks about another student in the article named Mariapaula Beltran. Beltran has also undergone a 
    breast augmentation. Leonardo states that "To Beltran, getting plastic surgery was not just about looking good on the outside, but it also gave her confidence 
    and inner peace. Is Beltran tempted to go under the knife again? 'Now, in this stage of my life, I feel complete and I do not plan to be having any surgery in 
    upcoming years,' Beltran explained" (Leonardo 2017). Beltran is similar to Delgado in that they both were satisfied by their procedures and are happy with their 
    decision. However, Beltran differs from Delgado since she is not planning to get more procedures anytime soon while Delgado is. Since Beltran has undergone 
    breast augmentation and is pleased with the results, it is clear that she approves of the practice. However, the fact that her future plans differ from Delgado's 
    show how varied peoples' views on cosmetic surgery can be and it does not merely boil down to supporting it or not supporting it. Some people, like Delgado, 
    overwhelmingly support it to the point where they want even more procedures. Others, like Beltran, support cosmetic surgery while also being content with 
    only one procedure. 

</p>

<h3>Others Do Not Approve</h3>

<p>

    While some students are in support of cosmetic procedures, others disapprove of them. One of them is Juliet Norman, who wrote the article "Social Media 
    Normalizes Plastic Surgery in a Dangerous Way" for <i>The Berkely Beacon</i>. Similarly to <i>The Valencia Voice</i>, <i>The Berkely Beacon</i> is a 
    student newspaper. It is the newspaper for Emerson College. Norman, who was a student at Emerson College at the time the article was written, begins by 
    talking about a friend in middle school who wanted to spend money she received for her Bat Mitzvah on a nose job. Initially, Norman was supportive, but 
    overtime has grown more skeptical about cosmetic procedures. Throughout the article, she voices many of her concerns with cosmetic surgery. One of her main 
    concerns is that the growing popularity of cosmetic surgery will spread hurtful messages to young girls. Norman states "It makes sense that so many young 
    girls feel genuinely insecure when outside influences like Photoshop and social media constantly tell them they shouldn’t feel pretty just as they are. 
    Surgeries like rhinoplasty to achieve a tiny nose and blepharoplasty (more commonly known as double eyelid surgery), among others, continue to promote 
    eurocentric beauty standards as well" (Norman 2021). Norman's remarks about social media tie in with my section "Causes of Cosmetic Surgery." Based on evidence, 
    social media is shown to be a big factor in younger peoples' decisions to get cosmetic surgery. Thus, Norman is correct in saying that social media makes girls 
    feel inadequate about their looks. It is also interesting how Norman mentioned that cosmetic surgery promotes eurocentric beauty standards. When girls who are not white
    see photos of people who have received cosmetic procedures such as blepharoplasty, they may internalize a message of their natural features not being pretty 
    enough. This certainly is a harmful message and it is understandable why Norman would be worried about the influence on young girls. 
    


</p>

<p>

    Norman is not alone in her concerns. Previously, I discussed a video from the YouTube channel "TODAY" titled "'Snapchat Dysmorphia': Why Teens Are Turning 
    To Plastic Surgery." Before, I discussed Ryan and how his cosmetic procedure has vastly improved his life. Although Ryan supports cosmetic surgery, some of the 
    other students featured in the video had the opposite view. A group of college students, which consisted of NBC interns and their friends, were interviewed in 
    the video clip. This group voiced their concerns about cosmetic surgery and how it is affecting their peers. One student was concerned that people are getting 
    cosmetic surgery at too young of an age. She says "...I feel like you should wait until 21. You really aren't sure what you want. What I wanted at 16 is 
    completely different than what I want now" (TODAY 1:43-1:52). The student brings up a good point and her concern is one that many other college students may share.
    We change so much throughout our lives, especially in our teens and early twenties. At these ages, we experience so much mental and emotional development.
    It makes sense that college students will not have the exact same opinions and desires that they did even just a year ago. Even some college students who have 
    undergone cosmetic procedures do not have a completely positive view on them. The video also features a teenage girl named Ella Snyder, who got lip fillers. 
    Snyder feels more confident after her procedure and is overall happy with the work she had done. Despite her happiness, she also admits that she was influenced
    by beauty standards. Snyder states "I definitely do think that I kind of fell victim to these beauty standards perpetuated by pop culture and social media" 
    (TODAY 3:27-3:33). Evidently, Snyder does not completely support cosmetic procedures even though she has undergone some herself. She is very happy with the 
    outcome of her procedures, but she is still able to recognize that she may not have gotten these procedures for the right reasons. She acknowledges how beauty 
    standards have affected her decision and she displays some regret because of that. This further shows how complex views on cosmetic surgery may be. Even someone like 
    Snyder who has undergone cosmetic procedures and is happy with the results can still identify the ways in which they can be harmful. 

</p>

<h3>Survey</h3>

<p>

    In order to collect the opinons of even more students, I conducted a survey titled "College Student Cosmetic Surgery Survey." The survey was open to undergraduate 
    college students and participants were asked questions regarding their views on cosmetic surgery and whether they have desired or undergone any cosmetic procedures. 
    In total, I received responses from 29 students from multiple colleges. The majority of students (about 82%) attend Lewis University, about 14% attend Joliet 
    Junior College, and about 4% attend Illinois State University. 51.7% of the students are female, 44.8% are male, and 3.4% preferred not to say their gender. 

</p>

<p>

    Participants were asked how often they hear about cosmetic surgery in the media. 6.9% said they hear about it very often, 20.7% said often, 51.7% said 
    sometimes, 10.3% said rarely, and 10.3% said very rarely. No participants selected "never."

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults1.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    Based on the survey results, most college students have had exposure to cosmetic procedures in the media. Most students said they hear about it sometimes, and the 
    second highest percentage selected "often." Thus, it can be concluded that college students have a decent understanding of cosmetic procedures and have likely 
    formed opinions on them based on what they have been exposed to.

</p>

<p>

    Next, participants were asked which cosmetic procedures they hear about most often. The top three selected procedures were Botox injections (92.9%), lip filler 
    (85.7%), and Brazilian butt lift (71.4%). 

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults2.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    This gives us a good idea of what kind of procedures are being marketed and exposed to college students. These results 
    also make sense as these procedures fit in with current beauty standards. Botox injections are used to smooth wrinkles, and wrinkles are certainly not deemed
    "in style" by most people. On the other hand, large, plump lips certainly are. Certain celebrities like Kylie Jenner have popularized having larger than 
    average lips, which may be the reason why so many people hear about lip fillers. The Brazilian butt lift is another procedure that people undergo in order to fit 
    into modern beauty standards. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj have popularized exaggerated hourglass figures, and along with those figures comes a 
    large behind. Thus, it is easy to see why the Brazilian butt lift is exposed to college students so often.

</p>

<p>

    Participants were then asked whether they typically see cosmetic surgery portrayed in a positive or negative way. 10.3% selected "positive", 17.2% said "negative", 
    and 69% said "somewhere in between." 3.4% said that they "do not see or hear others talk about cosmetic surgery."

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults3.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    Based on these results, most college students do not see cosmetic surgery portrayed as completely positive or completely negative. However, more participants selected 
    "negative" than "positive." This goes to show that not all information presented to people about cosmetic surgery is positive. This may be because some people do not 
    address the benefits of cosmetic surgery.

</p>

<p>

    Participants were asked whether they have seen cosmetic surgery being promoted on social media. 64.3% said yes while 35.7% said no.

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults4.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    Over half of the respondents said they have seen cosmetic surgery promoted on social media. Evidently, cosmetic surgery is becoming more popular and widespread. 
    This data shows how common it is for cosmetic procedures to be promoted to people on social media, especially to college students. This makes sense since 
    most college students are active on social media. If a surgeon wants to advertise a procedure to young people, then utilizing social media is the best way to go.

</p>

<p>

    In the next question, the participants were asked if they have undergone a cosmetic procedure for non-medical reasons. 6.9% said yes while 93.1% said no.

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults5.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    This data shows that most college students have not undergone a cosmetic procedure despite the frequent promotion they see on social media.

</p>

<p>

    Afterwards, the participants were asked whether they had received plastic surgery for medical reasons. 3.4% said yes and 96.6% said no.

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults6.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    In a way, these results were surprising. Although the percentages are close, there were more participants that had undergone cosmetic surgery for cosmetic reasons 
    than participants who had received plastic surgery because of medical problems. This shows how cosmetic surgery for purely cosmetic reasons is starting to become 
    more common.

</p>

<p>

    Participants were then asked whether they had ever desired a cosmetic surgery. 37.9% said yes and 62.1% said no. 

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults7.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    While most participants said that they did not desire a cosmetic procedure, there is still over a quarter of them said they did. Although very few have actually undergone a procedure, 
    many college students still desire one. The participants were then asked the reasons why they wanted a cosmetic procedure and which procedures they desired. 
    The majority of responses listed beauty standards and insecurities as one of the reasons. Rhinoplasty was a common procedure that the participants wanted. 
    One participant said "I've probably desired a lip filler or chemical peel before. I think growing up I thought I had smaller lips, even though they are 'normal' 
    sized, but lots of celebrities had lip fillers at the time so I had an augmented view. And I've desired a chemical peel because apparently it is good for your skin 
    and helps with pores and what not and sometimes I'm insecure about my skin." (Stumpf 2023). It is clear that insecurities and celebrities can play a big role in 
    whether a college student desires a cosmetic procedure. This further confirms my findings in my "Causes of Cosmetic Surgery" section.

</p>

<p>

    The participants were then asked whether they think cosmetic surgery should become more or less accepted. 10.3% said it should be more accepted and 31% said it should 
    be less accepted. 58.6% said they were indifferent about cosmetic surgery. 

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults8.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    Since the majority of participants are indifferent, this suggests that most college students do not have strong opinions one way or the other when it comes to 
    cosmetic surgery. However, there were more participants who believed it should be less accepted than those who believed it should be more accepted. This shows that 
    some college students disapprove of cosmetic surgery's growing popularity.

</p>

<p>

    The final question that the participants were asked was if they thought cosmetic surgery was good or bad. The results were similar to the results of the 
    previous question. The majority (65.5%) were neutral about cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, 27.6% thought it was bad and 6.9% thought it was good.

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "surveyResults9.png" style = "width:600px;">
</div>

<p>

    Similarly to the previous results, this data suggests that most college students are neutral about cosmetic procedures. They do not see them as a good thing, but 
    they do not view them as a bad thing either. While this is the opinion of the majority of participants, not all of them were neutral on the topic. Over a quarter 
    of participants view cosmetic surgery negatively. There are many reasons why they may think this way. Perhaps they are already aware of some of the dangers of 
    undergoing a cosmetic procedure. Another possibility is that they simply believe keeping yourself natural is the best way to go. Since cosmetic surgery is growing 
    in popularity, it makes sense that there will also be some pushback against it. Many things that become popular will always have opponents. A small amount of the 
    students think cosmetic surgery is a good thing. They may be aware of the mental benefits of undergoing cosmetic procedures or may desire some themselves. 

</p>

<p>

    Based on my findings, college students have mixed opinions on cosmetic surgery. While many are not for or against it, others have concrete views. Some view cosmetic surgery as 
    something bad and do not think it should become more accepted in society. On the other hand, other students think cosmetic surgery is positive and it should 
    become more accepted. Every person is unique and college students as a whole will not fit into one box. It is important to understand each point of view regarding 
    cosmetic surgery and why someone feels the way they do. It is also important to educate each other on topics such as this one and make sure that students are aware 
    of the good and bad aspects of cosmetic surgery.

<h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>

<p>

    Cosmetic surgery has been growing in popularity. There are many reasons someone may choose to undergo a cosmetic procedure. Some people are influenced by 
    societal beauty standards, which can make people feel as if they need to fit into society's idea of attractiveness. Body dysmorphic disorder can also factor into 
    someone's decision. Social media is a big reason since there are many proponents of cosmetic surgery and many people are influenced by what they see on social media
    sites. The desire to get into a relationship can be another motivation for someone to get a cosmetic procedure. By improving their appearance, they can increase 
    their chances of finding a partner.

</p>

<p>

    Cosmetic surgery has both drawbacks and benefits. Some consequences of cosmetic procedures include implant rupture, permanent scarring, and temporary side effects 
    such as irritated skin and swelling. Although there can be negative physical effects, there are positive mental ones as well. Cosmetic surgery can make people 
    appear more appealing and friendly to others. Additionally, it can increase someone's confidence and make them feel better about themselves. 

</p>

<p>

    When it comes to how college students feel about cosmetic surgery, there is a mixture of opinions. Most students hear about cosmetic surgery and see it being 
    promoted from time to time. There is also a good amount of college students that desire a cosmetic procedure and others have even gotten some already. Most students 
    see a mix of positive and negative portrayals of cosmetic surgery. This may tie in with why most students have neutral opinions on the topic. Overall, 
    college students do not have strong opinions for or against cosmetic surgery and are indifferent when it comes to how much it is accepted. 

</p>

<p>

    Due to the increasing popularity of cosmetic procedures, the numerous benefits and drawbacks, and the various views that college students have on cosmetic surgery, 
    it is very important for more people to be educated on this topic. Many people are unaware of some of the negative consequences that can occur when getting a 
    cosmetic procedure. Thus, it is important for people to understand these dangers. However, cosmetic surgery is not all bad either. If the procedure goes well, then 
    the patient can have an improved self-image. It is important for college students to take all of this information into account before choosing to undergo a cosmetic 
    procedure. There is so much more to these procedures than what is shown on social media. Take the benefits into account, but also be aware of the consequences before 
    making such a big decision. This will help you figure out if cosmetic surgery is truly the best choice.
