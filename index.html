<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>

    Over the years, cosmetic surgery has grown in both popularity and accessibility. Societal
    beauty standards are promoted in movies, magazines, television shows, and social media.
    Most people do not fit into cookie-cutter expectations of perfection, and thus some turn to cosmetic
    surgery in order to attain the beauty ideals presented to them. Cosmetic surgery, as many of you
    are aware, is a procedure where the patient has a part of their body altered for cosmetic reasons.

<p>

    Popular cosmetic surgeries are liposuction, which is a fat removal procedure, breast augmentation,
    which alters the size and shape of the breasts, and rhinoplasty, which changes the shape of the nose.
    Certain procedures, such as the Brazilian butt lift and buccal fat removal, have become trends. Many
    celebrities, like the Kardashians, have gotten work done. This has led to cosmetic surgery becoming
    more well known. Social media has also played a role, as unrealistic beauty standards are propagated
    by social media apps like Instagram. Another factor is that cosmetic surgery has decreased in price
    and there are more and more cosmetic surgeons offering their services.  

</p>

<p>

    As a college student who is active on social media, I have personally been exposed to a lot of information
    regarding cosmetic surgery. Seeing the advertisements of cosmetic surgeons on Instagram has intrigued me.
    I see so much promotion of cosmetic procedures, but never hear about the effects. I began to wonder whether
    cosmetic surgery was even worth it. This prompted me to research cosmetic surgery in depth. What are the effects
    of cosmetic procedures? And how do other college students feel about them? I needed answers.

</p>

<p>

    After extensive research, I have gained a better understanding of cosmetic surgery and I would like to share
    my findings with you. Based on what I have learned, I have determined that college students should be allowed to
    undergo cosmetic procedures, however it is extremely important to take the possible consequences into account before
    making such a drastic decision.

<!--Causes-->
<h2><u>Causes of Cosmetic Surgery</u></h2>

<p>

    Before diving into the ways cosmetic surgery can affect people, I believe it is important to analyze why people pursue
    these procedures in the first place. My research has shown me that there is a variety of factors that can motivate
    people to get cosmetic surgery, and our society as a whole may be to blame.

</p>

<!--Discuss materialism-->
<p>

    Beauty standards and materialism have become very prevalent in American society, and Donna Henderson-King and Kelly 
    D. Brooks explain their role in the cosmetic surgery industry in their article "Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance 
    Messages, and Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic Surgery." They surveyed female 
    undergraduate college students. Based on their findings, "Women who were higher on internalization and materialism were 
    more likely to accept cosmetic surgery for intrapersonal reasons and for social reasons, to consider having cosmetic surgery, 
    and to report a desire for more cosmetic surgery procedures" (pg. 138). As psychology professors with Ph.Ds., their information 
    is well-founded, as they have an advanced understanding of how the mind works and why people think the way they do. Based on this
    quote, it is clear that internalizing beauty standards can affect the way people view cosmetic surgery. This makes sense since 
    cosmetic surgery can be a tool to help fit into current beauty standards, as someone can achieve certain features even if they were 
    not born with them. Evidently, beauty standards have a great influence on people. This is no secret to us college students, and 
    this article validates our experiences and provides clear evidence of the affects that beauty standards are having on people. 
    It also makes sense that materialism can promote acceptance of cosmetic surgery and the desire to undergo it. People who are 
    materialistic place value on physical appearance, and therefore it is easy to see why someone who is materialistic would want to 
    change their appearance. The results of Henderson-King and Brooks' study confirm that beauty standards and materialism can all 
    play a role in a young woman’s opinions on cosmetic surgery.

</p>

<p>

    Another reason someone may choose to undergo cosmetic surgery is because of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is a disorder
    where a person has an obsession with a perceived flaw of their appearance. This disorder can have a great negative impact on
    someone's quality of life and self-esteem. Adriana C. Panayi investigated the frequency of BDD among cosmetic surgery patients
    in her article  “The Prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder In Patients Undergoing Cosmetic Surgery: A Systematic Review.”
    Here, Panayi states that "The rate of BDD in patients seeking cosmetic surgery was originally thought to be 2%, which is similar
    to the rate seen in the general population (Andreasen 1977). More recent studies, however, indicate a much higher rate of BDD"
    and "This data suggests that BDD has the highest prevalence in cosmetic surgery populations, followed by the student population, 
    and is least prevalent in the general community" (pg. S440). Based on this information, BDD is evidently more common amongst people 
    who get cosmetic surgery as opposed to the rest of the population. This likely is not a coincidence. It is safe to assume that
    BDD can be a contributing factor in someone pursuing cosmetic surgery. This makes a lot of sense since BDD patients struggle
    with accepting a physical trait about themselves that they view as a flaw. For people dealing with BDD, their obsession
    over this flaw goes far beyond an insecurity. Instead, it is something that greatly impairs their enjoyment of life. Cosmetic 
    surgery can be used to "correct" their perceived flaw, and thus it is easy to see why someone with BDD would desire cosmetic surgery.
    This can also tie in with the beauty standards that I discussed previously, as beauty standards may contribute to or worsen BDD.

    There is another factor for why someone may want cosmetic surgery, and it is one many of you are familiar with: social media.
    Social media has become extremely popular. Many social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok are widely used, especially by
    college students. Social media influencers, who are typically conventionally attractive, have become very popular. Social media
    also takes advantage of filters, which can alter a person's face and body. Dr. Sepideh Saber, a board certified plastic surgeon,
    discusses social media's influence in her blog entry "The 'Instaface Effect': How Social Media Shapes Plastic Surgery
    Expectations." According to Dr. Saber, "... 72% of cosmetic surgeons saw patients who “wanted to look better in selfies” coming 
    for consultations. In 2021, a survey study by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons showed that nearly half of all patients 
    reported social media played a role in their decision to seek plastic surgery." This data is astounding and shows the extent to
    which social media is affecting us. It is undeniable that social media is motivating people to receive cosmetic procedures and 
    alter their appearances. When people are exposed to images of perfection on social media, it makes sense that they would want
    to replicate the appearances of their highly admired influencers. The filters that I previously mentioned are also likely to play
    a role. Someone may like the changes a filter made to their appearance and thus try to recreate it in real life. Social media's 
    effects are also highlighted by Josh Wilson in his article "Cosmetic Surgery Is On The Rise With Technology And Hollywood Is At The 
    Center Of It". In this article, Wilson cites various plastic surgeons who say social media has contributed to the increased popularity
    of cosmetic procedures. Wilson cites Darren Smith, a surgeon, who said "'I think social media plays a tremendous role,' he said. 
    'We're seeing social media setting all kinds of trends, as people are having faster and more frequent access to latest celebrity looks 
    and trends.'" There is a lot of validity to Smith's statement. Many celebrities are extremely active on social media. Since celebrities
    are greatly looked up to, they can have a lot of influence on their fans. Some fans may even want to look like their favorite celebrities
    or may view a celebrity as the epitome of beauty. Seeing the frequent pictures that celebrities post on social media can increase these feelings.
    The American Society of Plastic Surgeons further confirms the role that social media plays. In their article "American Society of Plastic 
    Surgeons Weighs in on Growing Popularity of Teen Plastic Surgery", they discuss the factors that contribute to the desire among teenagers
    to undergo cosmetic procedures. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons states "In an age of selfies and constant social media sharing, 
    a growing number of teenagers are undergoing plastic surgery to alter their appearance" and "...today's social media-obsessed culture 
    has contributed dramatically to a rise in plastic surgery...". The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is a leading information source
    when it comes to cosmetic surgery and consists of many board-certified cosmetic surgeons. It also lists real statistics and facts while 
    taking a neutral stance. Clearly, it is an extremely credible source. By admitting how social media is responsible for the increase 
    of teens undergoing cosmetic procedures, they confirm how influential it has become. Additionally, "teens" can still include 18 and 19,
    which are the ages of most freshman college students. It is safe to infer that social media has a great amount of influence on college
    students.
