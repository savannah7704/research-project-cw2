<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>

    Over the years, cosmetic surgery has grown in both popularity and accessibility. Societal
    beauty standards are promoted in movies, magazines, television shows, and social media.
    Most people do not fit into cookie-cutter expectations of perfection, and thus some turn to cosmetic
    surgery in order to attain the beauty ideals presented to them. Cosmetic surgery, as many of you
    are aware, is a procedure where the patient has a part of their body altered for cosmetic reasons.

</p>

<p>

    Popular cosmetic surgeries are liposuction, which is a fat removal procedure, breast augmentation,
    which alters the size and shape of the breasts, and rhinoplasty, which changes the shape of the nose.
    Certain procedures, such as the Brazilian butt lift and buccal fat removal, have become trends. Many
    celebrities, like the Kardashians, have gotten work done. This has led to cosmetic surgery becoming
    more well known. Social media has also played a role, as unrealistic beauty standards are propagated
    by social media apps like Instagram. Another factor is that cosmetic surgery has decreased in price
    and there are more and more cosmetic surgeons offering their services.  

</p>

<p>

    As a college student who is active on social media, I have personally been exposed to a lot of information
    regarding cosmetic surgery. Seeing the advertisements of cosmetic surgeons on Instagram has intrigued me.
    I see so much promotion of cosmetic procedures, but never hear about the effects. I began to wonder whether
    cosmetic surgery was even worth it. This prompted me to research cosmetic surgery in depth. What are the effects
    of cosmetic procedures? And how do other college students feel about them? I needed answers.

</p>

<p>

    After extensive research, I have gained a better understanding of cosmetic surgery and I would like to share
    my findings with you. Based on what I have learned, I have determined that college students should be allowed to
    undergo cosmetic procedures, however it is extremely important to take the possible consequences into account before
    making such a drastic decision.

<h2><u>Causes of Cosmetic Surgery</u></h2>

<p>

    Before diving into the ways cosmetic surgery can affect people, I believe it is important to analyze why people pursue
    these procedures in the first place. My research has shown me that there is a variety of factors that can motivate
    people to get cosmetic surgery, and our society as a whole may be to blame.

</p>

<!--Discuss materialism-->
<p>

    Beauty standards and materialism have become very prevalent in American society, and Donna Henderson-King and Kelly 
    D. Brooks explain their role in the cosmetic surgery industry in their article "Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance 
    Messages, and Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic Surgery." They surveyed female 
    undergraduate college students. Based on their findings, "Women who were higher on internalization and materialism were 
    more likely to accept cosmetic surgery for intrapersonal reasons and for social reasons, to consider having cosmetic surgery, 
    and to report a desire for more cosmetic surgery procedures" (pg. 138). As psychology professors with Ph.Ds., their information 
    is well-founded, as they have an advanced understanding of how the mind works and why people think the way they do. Based on this
    quote, it is clear that internalizing beauty standards can affect the way people view cosmetic surgery. This makes sense since 
    cosmetic surgery can be a tool to help fit into current beauty standards, as someone can achieve certain features even if they were 
    not born with them. Evidently, beauty standards have a great influence on people. This is no secret to us college students, and 
    this article validates our experiences and provides clear evidence of the affects that beauty standards are having on people. 
    It also makes sense that materialism can promote acceptance of cosmetic surgery and the desire to undergo it. People who are 
    materialistic place value on physical appearance, and therefore it is easy to see why someone who is materialistic would want to 
    change their appearance. The results of Henderson-King and Brooks' study confirm that beauty standards and materialism can all 
    play a role in a young woman’s opinions on cosmetic surgery.

</p>

<p>

    Another reason someone may choose to undergo cosmetic surgery is because of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is a disorder
    where a person has an obsession with a perceived flaw of their appearance. This disorder can have a great negative impact on
    someone's quality of life and self-esteem. Adriana C. Panayi investigated the frequency of BDD among cosmetic surgery patients
    in her article  “The Prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder In Patients Undergoing Cosmetic Surgery: A Systematic Review.”
    Here, Panayi states that "The rate of BDD in patients seeking cosmetic surgery was originally thought to be 2%, which is similar
    to the rate seen in the general population (Andreasen 1977). More recent studies, however, indicate a much higher rate of BDD"
    and "This data suggests that BDD has the highest prevalence in cosmetic surgery populations, followed by the student population, 
    and is least prevalent in the general community" (pg. S440). Based on this information, BDD is evidently more common amongst people 
    who get cosmetic surgery as opposed to the rest of the population. This likely is not a coincidence. It is safe to assume that
    BDD can be a contributing factor in someone pursuing cosmetic surgery. This makes a lot of sense since BDD patients struggle
    with accepting a physical trait about themselves that they view as a flaw. For people dealing with BDD, their obsession
    over this flaw goes far beyond an insecurity. Instead, it is something that greatly impairs their enjoyment of life. Cosmetic 
    surgery can be used to "correct" their perceived flaw, and thus it is easy to see why someone with BDD would desire cosmetic surgery.
    This can also tie in with the beauty standards that I discussed previously, as beauty standards may contribute to or worsen BDD.

</p>

<p>

    There is another factor for why someone may want cosmetic surgery, and it is one many of you are familiar with: social media.
    Social media has become extremely popular. Many social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok are widely used, especially by
    college students. Social media influencers, who are typically conventionally attractive, have become very popular. Social media
    also takes advantage of filters, which can alter a person's face and body. Dr. Sepideh Saber, a board certified plastic surgeon,
    discusses social media's influence in her blog entry "The 'Instaface Effect': How Social Media Shapes Plastic Surgery
    Expectations." According to Dr. Saber, "... 72% of cosmetic surgeons saw patients who “wanted to look better in selfies” coming 
    for consultations. In 2021, a survey study by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons showed that nearly half of all patients 
    reported social media played a role in their decision to seek plastic surgery." This data is astounding and shows the extent to
    which social media is affecting us. It is undeniable that social media is motivating people to receive cosmetic procedures and 
    alter their appearances. When people are exposed to images of perfection on social media, it makes sense that they would want
    to replicate the appearances of their highly admired influencers. The filters that I previously mentioned are also likely to play
    a role. Someone may like the changes a filter made to their appearance and thus try to recreate it in real life.

    Social media's effects are also highlighted by Josh Wilson in his article "Cosmetic Surgery Is On The Rise With Technology And Hollywood Is At The 
    Center Of It". In this article, Wilson cites various plastic surgeons who say social media has contributed to the increased popularity
    of cosmetic procedures. Wilson cites Darren Smith, a surgeon, who said "'I think social media plays a tremendous role,' he said. 
    'We're seeing social media setting all kinds of trends, as people are having faster and more frequent access to latest celebrity looks 
    and trends.'" There is a lot of validity to Smith's statement. Many celebrities are extremely active on social media. Since celebrities
    are greatly looked up to, they can have a lot of influence on their fans. Some fans may even want to look like their favorite celebrities
    or may view a celebrity as the epitome of beauty. Seeing the frequent pictures that celebrities post on social media can increase these feelings.

</P>

<p>
   
    The American Society of Plastic Surgeons further confirms the role that social media plays. In their article "American Society of Plastic 
    Surgeons Weighs in on Growing Popularity of Teen Plastic Surgery", they discuss the factors that contribute to the desire among teenagers
    to undergo cosmetic procedures. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons states "In an age of selfies and constant social media sharing, 
    a growing number of teenagers are undergoing plastic surgery to alter their appearance" and "...today's social media-obsessed culture 
    has contributed dramatically to a rise in plastic surgery...". The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is a leading information source
    when it comes to cosmetic surgery and consists of many board-certified cosmetic surgeons. It also lists real statistics and facts while 
    taking a neutral stance. Clearly, it is an extremely credible source. By admitting how social media is responsible for the increase 
    of teens undergoing cosmetic procedures, they confirm how influential it has become. Additionally, "teens" can still include 18 and 19,
    which are the ages of most freshman college students. It is safe to infer that social media has a great amount of influence on college
    students.

</p>

    Aside from social media, romance can also persuade someone to get cosmetic procedures. Many people strongly desire romantic and sexual relationships,
    and this is especially true for college students. It is natural for humans to want to connect with each other and find partners.
    While this is not true for everyone, looks may play a role in some peoples' choice of partner. The aspect of romance is mentioned in the book 
    "Cosmetic Surgery for Dummies" by R. Merrel Olesen, a medical director, and Marie B.V. Olesen, a cosmetic surgery consultant. In this book,
    they mention various factors for why younger people are getting cosmetic surgery, and one of them is romance. They state that young adults 
    "... are also seeking romance, so how they look and feel about themselves is an important concern. They're not going to suffer in silence; 
    they're going to get it fixed" (pg. 10). It is no surprise that the desire for romance plays a role in cosmetic surgery. Some people view
    their looks as the key to finding a partner, therefore if they feel that their looks are not up to par then they will find ways to improve them.
    While some people may wear makeup or dress nicely, others will go even further and alter the parts of themselves that they feel a partner will
    not view as desirable. Some people believe cosmetic surgery will be worth it if it means that they will become more attractive in the eyes
    of potential partners. Confidence is also important for some people when choosing partners. Confidence is typically a trait that many 
    people are attracted to. If someone gets cosmetic surgery and becomes more confident as a result, this will increase their desirability even more.
    Thus, it is understandable why romance can motivate people to get cosmetic procedures.

<h2><u>Dangers of Cosmetic Procedures</u></h2>

<P>

    Now that we have discussed some of the reasons people pursue cosmetic surgery, I would like to highlight some of the risks that go along with
    undergoing such procedures. These risks are not always talked about when cosmetic surgery is being discussed, and therefore I find great importance
    in pointing them out in order to ensure that people become more educated on this topic.

</P>

<p>

    One very popular procedure is breast augmentation, which can involve increasing breast size, decreasing breast size, and changing the breasts' shape.
    Despite the popularity of such procedures, their dangers often go unspoken. David B. Sarwer et al. study some of these dangers in his article 
    "Cosmetic Breast Augmentation Surgery: A Critical Overview". Sarwer has done a variety of research on body image and cosmetic surgery. He
    has been studying the subject since the 1990s. He has a deeper understanding of the motivations behind cosmetic surgery and how body image plays a role since
    he is a psychologist. Additionally, he is well versed in the history of breast augmentation. Many of the risks discussed by Sarwer are attributed to breast implants.
    When analyzing the consequences of silicone breast implants, Sarwer states "Most of the controversy surrounding the use of silicone implants has 
    been related to potential long-term complications. These complications include silicone bleed, autoimmune disease, polyurethane toxicity, and 
    implant rupture and leakage. These events may require surgical treatment or removal of the implant or may leave the patient with significant physical 
    discomfort or deformity" (pg. 846). These complications certainly do not sound appealing, yet they are not talked about as much as the procedures itself.
    It is valid to be concerned about these complications. While not all of these issues are common, they are still a possibility. It is beneficial to be aware of these dangers 
    because if they do occur, they can greatly decrease one's quality of life. Whether a complication is rare or not, people should always be aware of them and should
    be willing to accept the possibility of it occurring.

</p>

<p>

    There is, however, one complication that Sarwer listed that actually is quite common. This is the risk of implant rupture and leakage. According to Sarwer,
    "In prostheses removed from women up to 17 years after implantation, two thirds of implants (and all the implants over 10 years of age) were ruptured or
    leaking. In a similar study, 70% of removed implants 11–15 years old were found to be ruptured or leaking. Thus, it is likely that a woman will
    need several replacement implants throughout her lifetime" (pg. 846). Based on this data, it is undoubtedly likely that silicone breast implants will rupture or leak at some point.
    While implant ruptures are not deadly, they can still cause physical pain for the woman. Aside from the physical discomfort that can be experienced due to 
    implant rupture, this is definitely not comfortable for peoples' pocketbooks either. Replacing breast implants every few years will certainly rack up the 
    bills, and this is not a consequence that some people are willing to accept. Therefore, it is crucial to take this risk into account. It will not only
    produce physical consequences, but financial ones as well.

</p>

<p>

    Silicone implants are not the only kinds that cause complicatons. Sarwer also higlights some of the risks associated with saline implants. 
    He states "Infrequent complications include hematoma, infection, and hypertrophic scarring, all of which are estimated to occur in 1%–3% 
    of cases. More frequent complications include capsular contracture, mammographic interference, breastfeeding difficulties, and loss of nipple 
    sensation, all of which are estimated to occur in 10%–35% of cases" (pg. 847). Hematoma is a collection of blood at the site of the implant
    and hypertrophic scarring is when thick, raised scars form. Capsular contracture is a negative bodily response to an implant in which the scar 
    tissue surrounding the implant hardens and contracts around it. Mammographic interference simply means that it is more difficult for mammograms
    to be performed, which can be dangerous since mammograms help detect breast cancer. Breastfeeding difficulties can be extremely distressing for 
    mothers and loss of nipple sensation can lead to a decrease of enjoyment of certain sexual activities. Evidently, saline implants have many complications 
    and even the less severe ones can still impact someone's quality of life. These complications should not be brushed off just because some of them are 
    rare. It is genuinely very important to take these consequences into account when making the decision to get saline implants. A small chance is still a chance.
